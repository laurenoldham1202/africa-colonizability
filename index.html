        <div class="block" style="">

            Part of the map series created by John George Bartholomew (cartographer) and Harry Hamilton Johnston
            (author) in <a href="https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/historyofcoloni00john" target="_blank">
            A History of the Colonization of Africa by Alien Races</a>,
            <a href="https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47df-fd22-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99>" target="_blank">
                <em>Colonizability of Africa</em>
            </a> <sup>[1]</sup> maps the continent carved into desirable/'healthy' and undesirable/'unhealthy' areas for
            European colonization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally published in the late nineteenth century, Johnston's work serves as a time capsule into the
            political context of the colonization of Africa.
        </p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section id="chapter-1">
        <h2>Mapping and Power</h2>

        <p>
            Until very recent modern history, mapmaking has exclusively been in the hands of the wealthy, powerful elite.
            In fact, the European exploration of Asia, Africa, and the Americas is responsible for the early proliferation
            of cartography in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Maps served purposes beyond simple exploration during
            this time - mapping was a central tool in colonizing and subjugating 'others,' i.e. non-white non-Europeans.
            Matthew Edney explicitly states, "Mapmaking was integral to the fiscal, political, and cultural hegemony of
            Europe's ruling elites" <sup>[2]</sup>.
        </p>

    </section>
    <section id="chapter-2">
        <h2>Mapping and Power (continued)</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Colonizability of Africa</em> exemplifies these power dynamics. Harry Hamilton Johnston, a British
            explorer and colonial administrator <sup>[3]</sup>, sees Africa as nothing more than a resource and
            opportunity to spread European influence. The continent is carved up into different areas of suitability for
            European preferences with no regard for existing groups, cultures, or land rights.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="chapter-3">
        <h2>Borders</h2>
        <p>
            Johnston's map indicates a complete lack of regard for any existing African borders. Faint lines crisscross
            the continent, but they are hardly discernible if not actively looked for. The message is clear: the only
            important demarcations on the map are the discrete groupings of 'healthy' and 'unhealthy' areas. Mapping
            borders (or intentionally excluding them) is an important tool in asserting territorial rights <sup>[4]</sup>,
            which is exactly the intent here.
        </p>
        <p>
            African input is notably absent in this map - they do not have the power to map themselves and claim land
            rights. Again, mapping is exclusive to the elite.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="chapter-4">
        <h2>City and Place Labels</h2>
        <p>
            Juxtaposing C. Kelso's examples of map styles used to hide or minimize black African settlements as opposed
            to white ones in Apartheid South Africa <sup>[6]</sup>, <em>Colonizability of Africa</em> instead highlights
            cities, ports, rivers, and other natural features and settlements in great detail. The borders <em>between
            </em> groups of Africans are largely ignored, whereas concentrations of Africans are illuminated.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of this map is not to prove the superiority of white European settlers; rather, the purpose of
            this map is to outline <em>where Africa will be most useful and profitable to white European settlers.</em>
            It is therefore important to list and map all potential resources the continent could provide, as well as
            potentially hazardous or difficult areas to settle.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="chapter-5">
        <h2>Map Scale</h2>
        <p>
            Also of note is the <strong>accurate scale representation of the African continent</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of the most popular maps are in the Mercator projection, which is commonly critiqued for its (outright
            racist) minimization of Africa, with Western/Europeans areas inflated and the African continent shrunken
            <sup>[5] *</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Colonizability of Africa</em> flips the script by highlighting the vastness of the continent. In this
            case, it was important to <strong>emphasize</strong> the true size of Africa, and therefore its extent of
            possible colonization and resources.
        </p>
        <small>
            * Tools such as <a href="https://thetruesize.com/" target="_blank">The True Size</a> challenge popular map
            misconceptions.
        </small>
    </section>
    <section id="chapter-6">
        <h2>Color</h2>
        <p>Bartholomew utilizes four discrete colors to represent Johnston's four divisions of Africa:</p>
        <p><strong style="color: #e1a572">Red</strong> represents 'Healthy colonizable Africa.'</p>
        <p><strong style="color: #fdeb7f">Yellow</strong> represents 'Fairly healthy Africa.'</p>
        <p><strong style="color: #c0b887">Light grey/beige</strong> represents 'Unhealthy but exploitable Africa.'</p>
        <p><strong style="color: #5b4f2b">Slate grey</strong> represents 'Unhealthy Africa.'</p>
    </section>
    <section id="chapter-7">
        <h2>Red</h2>
        <p>
            Judith Tyner describes the influence of color on propaganda maps in her work <em>Persuasive Cartography</em>
            <sup>[7]</sup>. Every culture has color associations that can be used to shape how viewers read a map.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Western culture, the color red often represents 'badness' or danger, especially in maps. A first glance
            at <em>Colonizability of Africa</em> might give the impression that the southern and northern Mediterranean
            areas of Africa are undesirable danger zones. Bartholomew, however, utilizes red to indicate the best, most
            desirable (and therefore colonizable) areas of Africa.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="chapter-8">
        <h2>Yellow</h2>
        <p>
            Yellow generally has bright, happy connotations (sunshine and flowers and birds, oh my!), but when used in
            conjunction with red, often takes on a meaning of relativity: if red is bad, yellow or orange is 'less bad'
            or a warning.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Colonizability of Africa</em> uses yellow in the opposite way: here, yellow is used to describe less
            desirable but still potentially colonizable areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of color is interesting because it indicates the opposite of its cultural meaning in the Western
            world. Even more interesting is considering the symbolism from the African perspective - perhaps African
            inhabitants would agree that European colonization <em>is</em> bad and dangerous.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="chapter-9">
        <h2>Unhealthy Africa</h2>
        <p>
            The remainder of the continent is defined as <em>unhealthy Africa</em>. Interestingly, Johnston acknowledges
            the vast natural resources in the area, but states that it is 'impossible for European colonization.'
        </p>
        <p>
            Similar to Francis Amasa Walker's American Indian Reservation maps from the late 1800s <sup>[8]</sup>,
            Johnston and Bartholomew's map serves as a time capsule of the prevailing racism and superiority of colonial
            Europeans. Africa was nothing more than an opportunity for more land, wealth, and resources for colonizers.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="chapter-10">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <div class="block">
            <p>
            While Johnston's overt racism is jarring in a modern context, it is indicative of a centuries-long global
            conquest from European powers. Preceding an era of intentionally downplaying black African settlements,
            <em>Colonizability of Africa</em> is remarkable for its accurate scale and labeling of the continent, which
            is emblematic of its purpose to define Africa as an untapped resource. It is also notable for its
            unorthodox use of color, highlighting desirable areas in red and yellow, which are typically used to
            indicate badness or danger.
