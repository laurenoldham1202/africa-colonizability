        <p>
            Part of the map series created by John George Bartholomew (cartographer) and Harry Hamilton Johnston
            (author) in <a href="https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/historyofcoloni00john" target="_blank">
            A History of the Colonization of Africa by Alien Races</a>, <em>Colonizability of Africa</em> maps the
            continent carved into desirable/'healthy' and undesirable/'unhealthy' areas for European colonization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally published in the late nineteenth century, Johnston's work serves as a time capsule into the
            political context of the colonization of Africa.
        </p>

        <h3>Map Scale</h3>
        <p>
            Immediately of note is the <strong>accurate scale representation of the African continent</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of the most popular maps are in the Mercator projection, which is commonly critiqued for its minimization
            of Africa - the continent is represented much smaller than its actual area, whereas Western areas are inflated.
            (Tools such as <a href="https://thetruesize.com/" target="_blank">The True Size</a> challenge popular map
            misconceptions.)
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Colonizability of Africa</em> highlights the vastness of the continent. In this case, it was
            important to <strong>emphasize</strong> the true size of Africa, and therefore its extent of possible
            colonization and resources.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="chapter-2">
        <h3>City and Place Labels</h3>
        <p>
            Juxtaposing C. Kelso's examples of map styles used to hide or minimize black African settlements as opposed
            to white ones in Apartheid South Africa, <em>Colonizability of Africa</em> instead highlights cities, ports,
            rivers, and other natural features and settlements in great detail.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of this map is not to prove the superiority of white European settlers; rather, the purpose of
            this map is to outline <em>where Africa will be most useful and profitable to white European settlers.</em>
            It is therefore important to list and map all potential resources the continent could provide, as well as
            potentially hazardous or difficult areas to settle.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="chapter-3">
        <h3>Color</h3>
        <p>Bartholomew utilized four discrete colors to represent Johnston's four divisions of Africa:</p>
        <p><strong style="color: #e1a572">Red</strong> represents 'Healthy colonizable Africa.'</p>
        <p><strong style="color: #fdeb7f">Yellow</strong> represents 'Fairly healthy Africa.'</p>
        <p><strong style="color: #c0b887">Light grey/beige</strong> represents 'Unhealthy but exploitable Africa.'</p>
        <p><strong style="color: #5b4f2b">Slate grey</strong> represents 'Unhealthy Africa.'</p>
    </section>
    <section id="chapter-4">
        <h3>Red</h3>
        <p>
            Judith Tyner describes the influence of color on propaganda maps in her work <em>Persuasive Cartography</em>.
            Every culture has color associations that can be used to shape how viewers read a map.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Western culture, the color red often represents 'badness' or danger, especially in maps. A first glance
            at <em>Colonizability of Africa</em> might give the impression that the southern and northern Mediterranean
            areas of Africa are undesirable danger zones. In actuality, Bartholomew utilizes red to indicate the most
            desirable, colonizable areas of Africa.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="chapter-5">
        <h3>Yellow</h3>
        <p>
            Yellow generally has bright, happy connotations (sunshine and flowers and birds, oh my!), but when used in
            conjunction with red, often takes on a meaning of relativity: if red is bad, yellow or orange is 'less bad'
            or a warning.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Colonizability of Africa</em> uses yellow in the opposite way: here, yellow is used to describe less
            desirable but still potentially colonizable areas.
            <!-- top 445 -->
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="chapter-6">
        <h3>Unhealthy Africa</h3>
        <p>
            The remainder of the continent is defined as <em>unhealthy Africa</em>. Interestingly, Johnston acknowledges
            the vast natural resources in the area, but states that it is 'impossible for European colonization.'
        </p>
        <p>
            Similar to Francis Amasa Walker's American Indian Reservation maps from the late 1800s, Johnston and
            Bartholomew's map serves as a time capsule of the prevailing racism and superiority of colonial Europeans.
            Africa was nothing more than an opportunity for more land, wealth, and resources for colonizers.
